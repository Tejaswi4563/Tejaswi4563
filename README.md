# AI Background and Music Remover

-----

## Overview

This project develops an **AI agent** capable of intelligently **removing background images from photos/videos** and **eliminating background music/noise from audio files**. Our agent prioritizes preserving the quality of the primary subject (e.g., foreground object, voice) and offers support for various file formats. As a bonus, users can even replace the removed background with a custom image or sound\!

## Features

  * **Intelligent Background Removal:** Accurately identifies and removes backgrounds from images and videos while maintaining foreground subject integrity.
  * **Noise and Music Elimination:** Cleanses audio files by isolating and removing unwanted background music or ambient noise.
  * **Quality Preservation:** Ensures the primary subject (visual or auditory) remains high-quality and uncompromised after processing.
  * **Multi-Format Support:** Handles a wide range of popular image, video, and audio file formats.
  * **Custom Background/Sound Replacement (Bonus):** Allows users to upload their own images or audio to replace the removed backgrounds.
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** (If applicable) A clean, intuitive, and responsive UI for seamless interaction.

## Expected Deliverables

  * **Well-documented Backend and Frontend:** Comprehensive documentation for both the server-side logic and the user interface.
  * **AI Model Integration:** Seamless integration of cutting-edge AI models or custom logic for background and noise removal.
  * **Sample Data/Mock APIs:** (If applicable) Provided for easy testing and development.
  * **Clean UI and Responsive Design:** (If UI is involved) A visually appealing and adaptable user interface.
  * **Authentication and Data Storage:** (If applicable) Robust mechanisms for user authentication and secure data handling.
  * **Documentation and Demo Video:** Thorough project documentation and a clear demonstration video showcasing the agent's capabilities.
